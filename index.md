# Welcome to my personal website!
From the age of eight to twenty-three, swimming taught me focus, discipline, and the ability to delay gratification. Growing up in a pizzeria taught me humility, and that everyone carries their own struggles. Curiosity taught me more skills than university ever did, but there I met people I learned even more from. I also got more immersed in science, which interests me a lot, because it reflects the pursuit of the next level and that’s always where I want to go.

If you’re on a similar path, I’d be glad to connect.


### Principles I live by:

- 🧭 **Forge your own path**: 
Disregard the “common route” in life, you are not like the people who recommended you that path.

- ⏳ **Mastery takes time**: 
The 10,000-hour saying might be an oversimplified generalisation, but I never seen a truly impressive person who hasn’t put in a lot of hours.

- 🫂 **Relationships matter most**: 
The people in your life are truly the most important thing. Surround yourself with people who strengthen you, and distance yourself from those who don’t.

- 🗣️ **Clarity in communication**: 
Communication is about projecting abstract ideas into a shared space. These exchanges lose some meaning in translation, but much can be preserved by listening carefully and being honest.

- ❓ **Ask the right questions**: 
Oftentimes it’s worth pausing to reflect on whether you are asking the right question, or just looking for 42?

- 🧠 **Build great heuristics**: 
You must develop efficient heuristics to be able to really use your brain, if your fast thinking (System 1) does not naturally guide you in the right direction, your slow thinking (System 2) won’t be able to work its magic.

- 🚀 **Pursue meaningful journeys**: 
Set ambitious goals, but make sure they are dependent on a stimulating journey, everything becomes easier that way.
