# Welcome to my personal website!
From the age of eight to twenty-three, swimming taught me focus, discipline, and the ability to delay gratification. Growing up in a pizzeria taught me humility, and that everyone carries their own struggles. Curiosity taught me more skills than university ever did, but there I met people I learned even more from. I also got more immersed in science, which interests me a lot, because it reflects the pursuit of the next level and that’s always where I want to go.

If you’re on a similar path, I’d be glad to connect.


### Principles I live by:

- 🧭 **Forge your own path**: 
Disregard the “common route” in life, you are not like the people who recommended you that path.

- ⏳ **Mastery takes time**: 
The 10,000-hour saying might be an oversimplified generalisation, but I never seen a truly impressive person who hasn’t put in a lot of hours.

- 🫂 **Relationships matter most**: 
The people in your life are truly the most important thing. Surround yourself with people who strengthen you, and distance yourself from those who don’t.

- 🗣️ **Clarity in communication**: 
Communication is about projecting abstract ideas into a shared space. These exchanges lose some meaning in translation, but much can be preserved by listening carefully and being honest.

- 🚀 **Pursue meaningful journeys**: 
Set ambitious goals, but make sure they are dependent on a stimulating journey, everything becomes easier that way.
