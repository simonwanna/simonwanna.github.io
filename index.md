# Welcome to my personal website!
From the age of eight to twenty-three, swimming taught me focus, discipline, and the ability to delay gratification. Growing up in a pizzeria taught me humility, and that everyone carries their own struggles. Curiosity taught me more skills than university ever did, but there I met people I learned even more from. I also got more immersed in science, which interests me a lot, because it reflects the pursuit of the next level and that’s always where I want to go.

If you’re on a similar path, I’d be glad to connect.


### Principles I live by:

- 🧭 **Forge your own path**: 
Disregard the “common route” in life, you are not like the people who recommended you that path.

- 🚀 **Pursue meaningful journeys**: 
Set ambitious goals, but make sure they are dependent on a stimulating journey, you will be spending a lot of time on it and life is short.

- ⏳ **Mastery takes time**: 
The 10,000-hour saying might be an oversimplified generalisation, but I never seen a truly impressive person who hasn’t put in a lot of hours.
